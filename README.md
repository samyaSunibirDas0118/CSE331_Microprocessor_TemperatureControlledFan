<b>Microcontroller:</b> Microcontrollers are integrated chips that are basically tiny computers. But,
microcontrollers are powerful enough to do a lot many things. The power requirements for these
integrated chips are very low and can be run on small batteries for days. Microcontrollers are way
cheaper than microprocessors.<br>
<b>Arduino:</b> Arduino is a circuit board that has a microcontroller in it.
